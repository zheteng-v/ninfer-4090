# tools/bench

Maintainer orchestration for the public `ninfer_bench` throughput tool, serving corpus/concurrency
runners, and the external Serve TTFT client. Correctness is owned by the affected suites under
[`tests/`](../../tests/README.md).

## External Serve TTFT

[`ttft/README.md`](ttft/README.md) defines the black-box latency benchmark. The measurement runner
uses frozen text/media requests and public streaming protocols without calling Engine. A separate
controller manages the fixed Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4/FP8 Serve profiles and fresh-process isolation.

```bash
python3 tools/bench/run_serve_ttft_campaign.py --campaign resource --samples 5
```

The controller chooses the profile, starts and stops Serve for every sample, runs the external
client, stages the NVFP4 artifact once in `/dev/shm`, stores raw/progress/Serve artifacts below
`profiles/bench/ttft/`, records structured per-request Serve diagnostics, and writes Markdown,
JSON, and CSV summaries. The case catalog, exact profiles, TTFT boundary, and fixture qualification
are documented in the dedicated README.

## Corpus baker

`ninfer_bench` benchmarks prefill at an exact length by slicing the first `P` token ids of a
committed corpus, so the corpus must be real, in-distribution text (not random tokens) and at
least as long as the largest prefill you want to run. `make_bench_corpus.py` bakes that corpus
offline with a local Hugging Face Qwen3.6 tokenizer.

Outputs (committed):

```text
bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.ids            whitespace-separated decimal token ids (exactly --tokens)
bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.manifest.json  tokenizer id, token count, and source description
```

Content sources:

- Built-in curated multi-domain prose (Chinese / English / code / math) — the default. It is
  encoded WITHOUT the chat template or special tokens, then tiled (paragraphs rotated each cycle)
  and truncated to exactly `--tokens`. Repetition only fills length; because prefill/decode
  throughput is token-count / bandwidth bound, it does not bias the numbers.
- `--source-text <file>` (repeatable) — tokenize your own long meaningful text instead, e.g. a
  downloaded public-domain book or a concatenated document set, for genuinely diverse very long
  content. The committed default is `~64k` tokens; raise `--tokens` and/or pass `--source-text`
  for more.

The binary slices `[0:P]`; the manifest is provenance only.

## Requirements

Install the tokenizer dependencies into the active Python environment:

```bash
pip install -r tools/bench/requirements.txt
```

The tokenizer is loaded locally only; the tool never downloads from the network. Pass
`--tokenizer-path` or set `NINFER_TOKENIZER_PATH`.

## Regenerate / check

```bash
# Regenerate the committed corpus from the built-in bank (default 65536 tokens).
python3 tools/bench/make_bench_corpus.py \
  --tokenizer-path /path/to/local/Qwen3.6-27B/tokenizer \
  --tokens 65536

# Bake from your own downloaded/assembled text instead (kept local; not committed).
python3 tools/bench/make_bench_corpus.py \
  --tokenizer-path /path/to/local/Qwen3.6-27B/tokenizer \
  --tokens 131072 --source-text /path/to/book.txt

# Check that the committed .ids and its descriptive manifest agree; no tokenizer or source needed.
python3 tools/bench/make_bench_corpus.py --check
```

`--tokens` is the exact committed corpus size and the ceiling on prefill length; increase it (and
optionally use `--source-text`) to benchmark longer prefills, memory permitting.

## NInfer performance matrix

`run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py` runs the layered public-Engine `ninfer_bench` matrix against the native
`.ninfer` artifact and stores its local reports under `profiles/bench/`. Its defaults are:

```text
artifact: out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer
binary:   build/bench/ninfer_bench
corpus:   bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.ids
```

The matrix treats MTP `k=3` with the optimized proposal head as the primary path, keeps `k=0` and
`k=5` as controls, and sweeps `k=0..5` on representative context-decode cases. Decode-bearing cases
cover CUDA Graph and eager execution; prefill-only cases vary prompt length and prefill chunk.

```bash
# Configure the benchmark targets once; they are off in the default public build.
cmake -S . -B build -DNINFER_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON

# Inspect commands without running the model.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset core --dry-run

# Main run. Builds build/bench/ninfer_bench first, then writes JSON and summary.csv.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset core

# Longer run that adds 32k/64k prompt and context-decode points.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset full

# Run only the MTP draft-window sweep.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset full --suite mtp_sweep
```

Default outputs:

```text
profiles/bench/ninfer-<preset>-<timestamp>/
  commands.sh
  manifest.json
  json/<suite>/<case>.json
  logs/<suite>.<case>.stderr.txt
  summary.csv
  summary.json
```

Use `--resume` to skip completed JSON reports in an existing `--output-dir`, and `--preset smoke`
for a minimal script/runner check. `--no-build` uses the binary supplied by `--bench` without
building it.

Each raw report must be `ninfer_bench_report` schema v15. The flattened summary and schema-v4 matrix
manifest carry native facts from the report: architecture, public name, actual formats, prefill signature, artifact,
load/read/upload/staging values, Engine memory arenas including the non-additive Vision layout
inside the unified workspace and CUDA Graph allowance, per-test planned logical and
allocator-observed workspace peaks, KV capacity and
payload, configured proposal head and graph mode, phase timings and throughput, and speculative
rounds/drafts/acceptance/fallbacks. The matrix manifest is descriptive and records the commands and
selected local inputs; it does not make repository state part of report validity.

## Serving corpus benchmark

[Published coverage and model results](../../docs/performance.md) identify the recorded runs.
The [serving methodology](../../docs/performance/methodology.md) owns workload definitions,
metric boundaries, aggregation, comparison rules, and publication format. This section describes
runner usage and output files.

`run_serve_corpus.py` accepts explicit `--artifact LABEL=PATH` entries. Labels identify report groups;
the selected artifact supplies the architecture, public name and weight bindings.
Omitting `--mode` selects MTP0 and MTP3; repeat `--mode` to select a subset. Use `dflash7` for
Qwen3.6-35B-A3B DFlash K=7, `dflash2_7` for Qwen3.8-27B DFlash2 K=7, and `dflash2_8` for the same
artifact at K=8 (block=9), with companion weights in the selected artifact. `--sampling greedy`
selects exact argmax; the default is stochastic.
Run commands with a selected Python 3.11 interpreter, as in the model-page reproduction entries.

The serial runner writes `run.jsonl`, `summary.csv`, `summary.md`, and per-server logs under
`server/`. JSONL contains the completed requests and responses; CSV/Markdown contain fixture and
category summaries. The output directory is supplied explicitly with `--output`.

Its schema-v9 result and flattened summaries retain the selected KV dtype, `max_context`, actual `prefill_signature`, request Host
exposure, and decode Host/Device-wait time per round received from the schema-v21 serving records.
Request exposure is a latency distribution value and is never summed across concurrent requests;
worker aggregation uses the serving `throughput.host_work` interval deltas. The stochastic route pins its complete
temperature/top-p/top-k/min-p/presence/frequency profile explicitly, so model-default changes do
not alter the measurement method.

`run_sm89_phase0.py` controls the RTX 4090 v2/v3 comparison. It takes explicit
`LABEL=NINFER_SERVE=MODEL_NINFER` candidate pairs, keeps INT8 and FP8 KV in separate result
trees, and preserves the fixed sampling profile, 1,024-token prefill chunk, disabled prefix
reuse, and MTP3 C=1/2/4/8 decode controls. `--phase screen` runs one fixed seed for the 7,680
token MTP0 prefill control and short code controls before `--phase full` runs five-seed corpus
and saturation points. Each candidate/KV tree contains a `manifest.json` with candidate and
runner-source hashes plus the selected host/GPU environment; resume rejects a manifest whose
source, candidate, request, or environment identity differs. Per-run server records retain the
actual CUDA ordinal and GPU UUID/name. The retained v2 server log is schema 20 and has no prefill
signature; that absence is explicitly recorded as `unreported-v2-schema20`.

For a focused speculative sweep without long-context or concurrency restarts, repeat
`--screen-mode` to select only the required routes. `mtp4` and `dflash2_6` are supported alongside
`mtp3` and `dflash2_7`; `--screen-fixture` and `--screen-seed` keep each request paired. For example:

`--screen-max-context N` sets both `--max-context` and `--kv-capacity` for screen corpus servers
only (default: 262144).
The corpus runner verifies that the selected fixture's manifest `prompt_tokens` plus `max_new`
fits, records the value in each schema-v9 result and summary, and rejects resume data from a
different context. The full phase keeps the default 262144 context and rejects a custom screen
context. For example, `scenario_code_python` has 122 prompt tokens and a 4,096-token completion
cap, so 8,192 is sufficient for a short-context profile while reducing high-position graph/KV
allocation. This setting is only a short-request screening optimization; it does not qualify
long-context performance or replace the 262144-context controls.

```bash
python3 tools/bench/run_sm89_phase0.py \
  --candidate v3=/path/to/ninfer-serve=/path/to/qwen3_8_27b_v3.ninfer \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --output profiles/bench/phase0-focused \
  --screen-mode mtp3 --screen-mode mtp4 \
  --screen-mode dflash2_6 --screen-mode dflash2_7 \
  --screen-fixture scenario_code_python --screen-seed 7632647173703958409
```

This focused form starts one fresh server per selected mode and omits the baseline MTP0 and
concurrency points. Keep the same fixture, seed, KV dtype, and candidate settings when comparing
against existing control records; use a fresh output tree when changing the screen definition.

## Concurrent serving benchmark

`run_serve_concurrency.py` selects `--suite decode-saturation` or `--suite corpus-makespan`.
Their distinct time boundaries and workload dispatch are defined in the
[serving methodology](../../docs/performance/methodology.md#workloads-and-measurement-boundaries).
Repeat `--concurrency` to select C points; each point starts a fresh server. The point report
records the actual Engine configuration, automatic KV capacity, shuffle seed where applicable,
dispatch method, and per-request positions.

Schema-v3 outputs include `points/*.json`, `server/*.jsonl`, and combined `summary.json`, `summary.csv`, and
`summary.md`. Corpus runs also write complete responses in `corpus/<point>/results.jsonl` and
per-request phase summaries in that directory; older campaigns may have only point reports and
server logs. Historical model pages identify the report directory associated with each table.

```bash
python3 tools/bench/run_serve_concurrency.py \
  --artifact qwen3_6_27b=out/qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --mode mtp3 --suite decode-saturation \
  --concurrency 1 --concurrency 2 --concurrency 4 \
  --decode-tokens 8192 \
  --output profiles/bench/concurrent-decode

python3 tools/bench/run_serve_concurrency.py \
  --artifact qwen3_6_27b=out/qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --mode mtp3 --suite corpus-makespan \
  --concurrency 1 --concurrency 2 \
  --output profiles/bench/concurrent-corpus
```

Use `--kv-capacity auto` when the fixed corpus needs more shared KV than the default 262,144-token
pool. A point is intentionally not resumable: combining fragments from separate server processes
would not preserve either a steady interval or one continuous makespan.
